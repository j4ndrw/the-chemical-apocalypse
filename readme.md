## Overview

**The Chemical Apocalypse** is my first attempt at developing a game using Raylib as the foundation. This project is a personal endeavor, and I’m sharing it to document my progress.

## Current State

The game engine is built from scratch, following the Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture. At this stage, the gameplay is quite basic: you can move around and evade an enemy that has some simple aggro and roaming behaviors.

I created the sprites myself, which is significant for me since this is my first attempt at pixel art. I used LibreSprite to make the sprite sheet, and I’ve found the process challenging, as I don’t have a background in art.

## Reason for Open Sourcing

Initially, I aimed to develop this game fully and share it with others. However, I encountered difficulties with the artistic aspects, particularly pixel art, which I find tedious and unenjoyable.

To address this, I decided to open-source the project. My hope is that someone else might take it on and help bring it to completion, or that I might return to it later with a fresh perspective.

Despite the challenges with art, I’m satisfied with the game engine I’ve built. I can see potential for using this foundation in future projects. Plus, I’ve included my cat, Peanut, as a character in the game! He’s a big part of my life, and it’s been fun to incorporate him into this project.

## Running the Game

To run the game, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
make run
```
