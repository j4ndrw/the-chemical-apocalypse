# Roadmap

## Game Mechanics
1. **Implement Combat System**:
   - Develop the turn-based combat mechanics.
   - Integrate the degree of violence system.
   - Create the action types (tactical, reactive, preparable).

2. **Design Action Limitations**:
   - Implement negative properties that affect player actions.
   - Create a system for limiting healing actions per floor.

3. **Real-Time Reaction Mechanics**:
   - Develop the timing mechanics for blocking and dodging.

4. **Enemy Behavior**:
   - Design enemy types with unique chemical compositions and predictable actions.
   - Implement AI for enemies to utilize their abilities effectively during combat.

5. **Item Discovery and Synergy**:
   - Create a system for item generation and discovery.
   - Develop mechanics for combining items to create synergies.

6. **Degree of Violence and Reaction Spectrum**:
   - Implement the reaction spectrum system to track the degree of violence.
   - Ensure that the impact of actions is calculated based on the spectrum.

## Art and Assets
1. **Character Design**:
   - Create character sprites and animations for the player and enemies.
   - Design visual effects for chemical abilities and actions.

2. **Environment Design**:
   - Develop various environments and levels for exploration.
   - Create background art and tile sets for different areas.

3. **User Interface (UI)**:
   - Design the HUD to display health, degree of violence, and action options.
   - Create menus for item management, character stats, and settings.

4. **Visual Effects**:
   - Develop visual effects for attacks, healing, and other actions.
   - Create animations for blocking and dodging mechanics.

## Logic and Systems
1. **Game Engine Selection**:
   - Choose a suitable game engine (e.g., Unity, Godot or self-made) that supports the desired mechanics and art style.

2. **Game State Management**:
   - Implement a system for managing game states (e.g., combat, exploration, menus).
   - Create save/load functionality to preserve player progress.

3. **Balancing Mechanics**:
   - Test and balance the combat mechanics, including the degree of violence and negative properties.
   - Adjust enemy difficulty and item effectiveness based on player feedback.

4. **Crafting System (Future Consideration)**:
   - Outline the mechanics for a crafting system that allows players to combine items and chemicals.
   - Plan for how crafting will integrate with existing gameplay mechanics.

## Testing and Feedback
1. **Playtesting**:
   - Conduct playtesting sessions to gather feedback on gameplay mechanics and balance.
   - Iterate on mechanics based on player feedback to improve the overall experience.

2. **Bug Fixing**:
   - Establish a process for identifying and fixing bugs during development.
   - Create a system for tracking issues and prioritizing fixes.

## Marketing and Community Engagement
1. **Build a Community**:
   - Create social media accounts and a website to share development updates.
   - Engage with potential players through forums and social media platforms.

2. **Demo and Marketing Materials**:
   - Develop a demo version of the game for early feedback and promotion.
   - Create promotional materials, including trailers and screenshots, to showcase the game.
